My version of HelloWorld.kt, a simple program that I started writing to learn Kotlin language and a PoC towards IntelliJ IDEA Plugins.

My aim: write IDEA plugin that will display a tool window, where one can do all the math towards units conversion for XLS_FO and/or HTML, so:

- "23mm" -> "Xin"
- "5in + 12pt" -> "Xcm"

Not working yet :)
